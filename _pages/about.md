Hello there! My name is Leon, I am  currently a postdoctoralresearch scholar in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Princeton University. I received the BSc in Physics from Bar-Ilan university at 2015, and a PhD in physics from Bar Ilan University at 2021.
I do research in quantum and nonlinear optics and current NISQ devices. I am very intersted in unconventional computing scheme, and different ideas and methods by which one can exploit physics to do useful computational tasks.
For a list of my publications, please head to my [publications page](/publications/).
